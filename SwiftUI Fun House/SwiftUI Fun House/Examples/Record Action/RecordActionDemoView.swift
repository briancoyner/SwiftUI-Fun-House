/// This demo shows how I recreated my High Rail app's SensorTrack recording view in SwiftUI.
///
/// Useful High Rail app links:
/// - https://highrailcompany.com/high-rail-app/
/// - https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id842021291
///
/// This demo shows a few different techniques:
/// - Custom `ButtonStyle` that:
///   - draws a "record" button.
///   - smoothly animates the "record" button between the SensorTrack recording states (idle, waiting, recording armed, and recording).
///   - See `RecordActionButtonStyle`
///
/// - Elapsed time view showing how to use a `Timer` to publish events every second using Combine.
///   - Shows a technique for cancelling a `Publishers.Autoconnect` when a view disappears.
///   - See `ElapsedTimeView`
///
/// - Playing sounds when the user interacts with the "record" button.
///   - see `RecordActionView`
///
/// - Using a `GeometryReader` and `RadialGradient` to make a nice looking background.
///   - See `SensorTrackRecordActionView`
///
/// - Picker (segmented control) to simulate non-user interactive SensorTrack recording state changes (non-animating).
